    <p>
      React Router is a powerful library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. It allows you to create single-page applications with multiple views by synchronizing the UI with the URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      With React Router, you can define routes, navigate between views, and pass parameters easily. It provides a declarative way to handle client-side navigation and helps create a smooth and interactive user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get started by setting up your routes, creating components for each view, and using the Link component to navigate between them.
